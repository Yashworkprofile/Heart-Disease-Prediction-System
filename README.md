# Heart Disease Prediction System
# Overview
Applied various classification algorithms to predict a person's health outcomes based on their medical history. The primary focus is on predicting heart disease risk.

# Features
High Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy using the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm.
Model Evaluation: Utilized a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance and compare it with Logistic Regression.
# Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Usage
Open the project.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run the notebook to see the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
# Results
The K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm is used to predict heart disease risk with high accuracy.
Model performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and compared with Logistic Regression.
